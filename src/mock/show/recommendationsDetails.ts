The season continues the stories of a group of over 40 people who have been stranded on a remote island in the South Pacific, after their airplane crashed there more than 90 days prior to the beginning of the season. According to Lost's executive producers/writers/showrunners Damon Lindelof and Carlton Cuse, there are two main themes in fourth season: "the castaways' relationship to the freighter folk" and "who gets off the island and the fact that they need to get back". Lost came under scrutiny from critics in its third season, but the fourth season was acclaimed for its flash-forwards, pace and new characters.\n` +

Following the strike's resolution, it was announced that only five more episodes would be produced to complete the season; however, the season finale's script was so long that network executives approved the production of a 14th episode as part of a three-hour season finale split over two nights. The fourth season aired Tuesdays at 9:00 pm from January 31 to March 20, 2008 and at 10:00 pm from April 24 to May 15, 2008. The two-hour finale aired at 9:00 pm on May 29, 2008.

But the computer, known only as "The Machine", can also identify ordinary people who are about to be involved in violent crimes. Can those crimes be stopped before they take place? Secretly tapping into The Machine, Finch and ex-CIA agent John Reese use vigilante tactics and state-of-the-art technology to identify the soon-to-be victims and prevent the crimes from occuring. Meanwhile, two NYPD detectives Joss Carter and Lionel Fusco are drawn into the cases and the mystery surrounding the two covert crime fighters.',
